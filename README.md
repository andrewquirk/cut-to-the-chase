# CS221 (Artificial Inteligence) Final Project

In our digital age, we are constantly bombarded with a seemingly infinite amount of information through sources such as social media, news articles, and instant messaging. Many times, the amount of diverse information (combined with increasingly shorter human attention spans) can lead to an apathy towards reading large amounts of text. This feeling is so common, that it has lead to the creation of the colloquial expression 'tl;dr' (too long didn't read) which refers to short, 3-5 sentence summaries of long sources of information. For our project, we created an algorithm that will generate readable, and useful, 'tl;dr' summary of a news article, automatically, given the article's original text.
